  "description": "This package exports Monad and MonadIter. For reason's I haven't yet ascertained, I can use it only by moving /node_modules/reactive-monads/index.js down to my entry files which contains \"monad = require('./index.js')\" and then \"var m = new monad.Monad(3)\". The demos are running online and can be accessed from [http://schalk.net](http://schalk.net). The code for those sites is available at [https://github.com/dschalk/](https://github.com/dschalk/). I find the monads to be very useful in organizing applications. As you can gather from websockets-monads-part2, complex applications can be organized into one data tree. The control structure is on top, and the various possible algoriths lay underneath. Much can be organized and controllin in not very many lines of code. Now that I no longer use observer functionality, the name of this package doesn't describe it well. These monads don't seem to have any use for FRP boilerplate now that I use snabbdom (https://github.com/paldepind/snabbdom) for browser updates.",
