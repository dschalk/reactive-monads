## Javascript reactive monads

The "index.js" file in this repository is the ES6 version of the file available from Node Package Manager (NPM) by entering "npm install reactive-monads". The Babel transpiler created the NPM version.

The online application at [http://transcendent.ninja](http://transcendent.ninja) demonstrates the use of reactive monads. The code for that site is available at [https://github.com/dschalk/mobservable-monads](https://github.com/dschalk/mobservable-monads). As the name implies, [mobservable](https://github.com/mweststrate/mobservable) makes the monads reactive.
