## DEPRECATED - replaced by js-monads

This package was published during the early stages of an investigation. I would remove it, but people have downloaded it and I don't want to pull the rug out from under any applications that are somehow using it. An online demonstration of the js-monads package is at http://schalk.net:3055 .

The project can be found at http://schalk.net. The most recent installment, JS-monads-stable, uses Motorcycle.js, which can be found at https://github.com/motorcyclejs.
